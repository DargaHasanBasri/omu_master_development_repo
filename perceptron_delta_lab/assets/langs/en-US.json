    "deltaExplanation": "The delta rule is a learning method that updates the weights of a single-layer neuron to minimize error. Also known as an online/iterative version of the least squares approximation (LMS), it incrementally refines the weights with a gradient derived from the difference (error) between the output and the target.",

    "perceptronExplanation": "The perceptron is the most fundamental building block of artificial neural networks. Developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958, this algorithm is used to solve binary classification problems."
